Generates posts from IDML documents.

=== Description ===
Have you ever have the need to generate a Wordpress post from an InDesign document? Yeah, me neither. But in case you do, this plugin is for you because this plugin allows you to generate a Wordpress post from an IDML InDesign document in four steps:

1. Upload the InDesign document. It has to be an IDML file, though.
2. Select the text frames to post.
3. Reorder the text frames.
4. Click the "Generate Post" button, sit back, and relax. Or, you know, do more editing.
